We decided to make a brewery finder, baisicaly how it works is the user types in there city and the
  application will output a map of the city and a list of all the names of the brewerys in the city.  
 
     Api's that we used were, 
 brewerydb
 mapquest.
 
    Challenges Experienced, 
We faced most of our challenges while trying to get the map to display the location of the brewerys. 
The search bar and map would work perfectly the first time; however
The user would imput there city and the map would show the locations and the website would display the list of the brewerys. 
The second time the user would search a city it would not display anything.

			If we had more time,
Give more information about each brewery. Examples include ratings, directions, menu, and photos.

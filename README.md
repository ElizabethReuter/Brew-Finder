# Project-1

[DeployedWebsite](https://elizabethreuter.github.io/Brew-Finder/)
	
We ddecided to make a brewery finder, which the user inputs any US city and the application outputs a map of the city with a list of all the breweries in the area. 
 
Api's used: 
 BreweryDB
 MapQuest
 
Challenges Experienced:
The challeneges that came up during this project dealt with the use of the map, search function and display of breweries. 
The map needed to be adjusted to fit in the container and continue to show each city. 
The search function had issues pulling information when doing a second search. 
The display of the breweries extended outside of the container if the list exceed more than 12.

If we had more time more information about each brewery would be displayed. Some examples include ratings, directions, menu, and photos.

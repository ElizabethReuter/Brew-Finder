    <p class="newhtml"> Owen Roth, Elizabeth Reuter, and Trey Jahner are three up and coming coders who are learning the basics.
        They recently were assigned a project where They would have to make a functional website that has some practical
        use!
        They decided to make a brewery finder, baisicaly how it works is the user types in there city and the
        application will output a map of the city and a list of all the names of the brewerys in the city.
    </p><br>
        <p class="newhtml">
        Api's that we used were,
        brewerydb
        mapquest
    </p><br>
        <p class="newhtml">
        Challenges Experienced, 
        They faced most of our challenges while trying to get the map to display the location of the brewerys, the search bar and map would work perfectly the first time the user would imput there city the map would show the locations and the website would display the list of the brewerys. The second time the user would search a city it would not display anything.
        Getting the Format to work for any type of device the user was on.
    </p><br>
        <p class="newhtml">
        If we had more time we would add ratings for each brewery
        A log in and sign out page where the users information gets saved they don't have to type in the city multiple times.
